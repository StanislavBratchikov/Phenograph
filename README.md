# Phenograph
Phenograph algorithm implementation
## Motivation
Project aims at researching whether splenic macrophages maintain their population via local proliferation (which classifies 
them as resident) or require monocytes for their maintenance. 
## Intro 
More about Macrophages classification can be read [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187515/).
Cx3cr1-ERCre x zsGreen mice were pulsed with tamoxifen on day 0 to label all Cx3cr1-expressing cells. We harvested spleens on day 7, 28, 35 and 42. In addition, at day 28 some mice were infected with low dose of influenza virus to activate lymphoid follicles in the spleen.
